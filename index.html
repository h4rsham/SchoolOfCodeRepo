I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for technology and software development. Despite having no prior experience in the field, I have been actively learning and acquiring new skills through online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects. My goal is to break into the software development industry and make a positive impact through the use of technology. I am eager to bring my strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and fast-learning ability to a challenging and rewarding role in the industry.

        Now, let me tell you a little bit about my hobbies and interests. I have a passion for a variety of things. Whether it's traveling and exploring new places, (making a small start to) reading and indulging in books, or perhaps participating in numerous sports (although not the best), I attempt to keep myself engaged and entertained 24 hours of the day and 7 days a week (sleeping counts). I'm always looking to expand on my interests and hobbies whether that may be for pure entertainment or improving myself as a person. Although slow to, I like to step outside my comfort zone which may potentially lead me to discovering something life-changing. This is what I consider a key aspect in what makes people unique and keeps life exciting. <br><br>
        Just for fun, here's a very condensed list of my bucket list:            
        <ul>
          <li>Watch Liverpool win a final at Anfield.</li>
          <li>Watch a live MMA title fight.</li>
          <li>See a live game of the Golden State Warriors in Los Angeles.</li>
          <li>(Hoping to one day) Be able to progress in a career that allows me to work anywhere in the world.</li>
          <li>And many more to list but we'd be here all day...</li>
        </ul>
